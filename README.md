# Send2Space-Website

https://www.lee-send2space.ml/

This website is a personal project for a club I founded in high school. It was a big part of my learning experince of front-end web design. I did a little backend with this this too. The contact page uses serverless azure which uses node.js and express.js to send an email to our email with a proper format.
