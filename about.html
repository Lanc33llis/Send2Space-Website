            Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p style="width: 60%; text-align: center; position: relative; left: 20%;">
            Welcome to LEE Send2Space! We’re a new chapter of Send2Space at LEE High School, based in San Antonio, Texas. 
            Our club is completely student-run, and our goal is to have our members design and build a high-altitude balloon (HAB) from scratch to send into low-orbit space. 
            Having started this club during the summer of 2020, we’ve faced some interesting challenges as we’ve navigated the mid-COVID-19 world. 
            These include hosting completely virtual meetings, organizing social distancing measures for working on the HAB in-person, and not being able to even take a team photo.
            <br><br>
            In the first month of LEE Send2Space, we’ve recruited 25+ members and raised over $500 to help reach our goal. 
            We’re currently working on designing and launching a test HAB to familiarize ourselves with the launch process before we launch a more complicated HAB with an even cooler payload!
            We’re also working on our website and are guiding those interested through the basics of web development using HTML and CSS. 
            We hope you’ll join us on Instagram @send2space_lee as we progress through this exciting journey and send things to space!
